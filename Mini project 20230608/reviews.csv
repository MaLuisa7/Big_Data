nitorita,"Mar 29, 2023",8,"A luxurious and high-caliber platform game that has no competition except for other Mario games. The game is already luxurious since the Wii U. However, there are impressive improvements such as team play, improving the walking shape of the characters (animation ), adding cooperative play in the missions of captain toad, and the most importantly wonderful addition, which is the two facts of the game Mario is completely independent. It is the addition of the Bowser's Fury game to the very huge world of cats, all of which confirms that it is a good bargain Sorry for my language"
ResetButton,"Nov 25, 2022",9,"I, like many others, didn't like 3d World when it first came out, but in retrospect, this game is great! It's rather linear and restrictive when compared to the more open ended nature of the previous games, but that's not really a bad thing, because the game is filled to the brim with creative ideas and it's linearity allows it to channel it in a focused manner. Maybe it isn't as great as some of its predecessors,  but it's never bad either. It's a consistent flow of inspired and creative platforming through a series of linear obstacle courses, and is almost 100% perfect in this regard. If you didn't like this game at first, I'd encourage you to play Mario Odyssey first, and play this one after that.  It helped me appreciate the game much more, and maybe it'll help you do the same."
eyalem123,"Mar 26, 2022",8,"I didn't had a wii U so I had never experienced Super Mario 3D World, but it's defenitly a must buy for Mario games fans. It's a hole new experience of the old 2D Mario formula with a new possibilities, worlds and mechanics. This game is even better in multiplayer, much funnier and gets really competitive since players can try to beat your highscore going all the way together.  For me, is a 9 out of 10. Maybe for someone that already played this on wii U it might be not all that fun but for newcomers like me, I recomend this 100%."
Audiostoned,"Apr 11, 2023",9,"This is a great bundle from Nintendo. Not only do you get Super Mario 3D World re-released on the switch, which is a great new take on the old formula, but you get the new edition of Bowser's Fury. While Bowser's Fury is a short game (about 2-3 to beat and 4-6 to 100%) it is an instant classic. The edition of the ""day and night cycle"" that has Bowser being dormant during the day and him becoming a giant monster at night creates a wonderful dynamic that keeps you on your toes. The game plays completely different in each cycle, and the giant boss battles are quite fun. One of my favorite things about this bundle is the multiplayer. You can play with up to four people, which adds extra enjoyment in 100% the game, trying to beat each others scores, or just playing the base game. Bowser's Fury also has up to four players which is very nice, but the best part is the two player local play. The second player gets to play as Bowser Jr which is a great improvement upon Cappy. I found that Bowser Jr was vital to the game, and it made it that much better when someone was playing with me. There are only two flaws in this bundle. The first is how short Bowser's Fury is, and the second is one of the games is already released. But both of these are tiny issues. Bowser's Fury is re-playable and worth it just for the first playthrough, and the whole point was the re-release of Super Mario 3D World on the switch so I'm just glad they included a new title with it. 3D Mario World + Bowser's Fury is a great bundle that I will come back to time and time again. Thank you Nintendo for another classic installment."
BlueNightDev,"Feb 17, 2021",9,"This is an Amazing game! I absolutely love each level, they are filled with unique ideas and charm. I have never owned a Wii U so I am extremely happy to be able to experience this game. Bowser’s fury is quite great as a bonus game, but to me personally Super Mario 3D World is the best out of both. I preferred the stars from this one than odyssey’s moons because I actually felt as if they were attainable as their isn’t as much than the insane amount of moons in Odyssey. ( But that is just me ) also find this game much more appealing because of all the amazing playable characters that you can be- instead of just Mario. The multiplayer experience is awesome but it can sometimes get quite chaotic especially in the cake level with the red and blue switch blocks;). I love this game, you should try it and see all the amazing content that this game has to offer, the multiplayer but single player experience are phenomenal and fleshed out to give you hours of entertainment. A must buy and my favourite video game, I love Super Mario!"
SuperkenGaming,"Feb 18, 2021",9,"Super Mario 3D World et Bowser's Fury sont un excellent mélange. Avec d'un côté un portage excellent, améliorant un platformer déjà excellent sur de nombreux points. Et de l'autre une vraie aventure originale rafraîchissement et à la proposition d’un gameplay étonnant. Cette réédition d'un des meilleurs opus de la saga s'affirme comme un véritable indispensable sur Nintendo Switch. Si tous les portages Wii U ne se valent pas et que beaucoup ne justifient pas forcément de nouvel investissement à prix fort, Super Mario 3D World avec Bowser's Fury est l’un des meilleurs jeux de la machine à ce jour. Et qui sait, en fonction de la réception de Bowser's Fury, Nintendo y verra peut-être l'occasion de proposer à l'avenir une expérience complète et 100% inédite. Plus de détail >> https://www.geekexperience.fr/jeux-video/avis/avis-super-mario-3d-world--bowsers-fury"
anyu,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"A great port of Super Mario 3D World! The characters and visuals move more quicker, a lot of new features and new mechanics that haven't been seen in the Original Wii U release. Also, the fact that this is the 5th 3D Mario game (3 if you count 3D All Stars as one game) to be on the Switch is also incredible. Bowser's Fury is a great mode too! It even feels like that it could be it's own separate game."
JordiMesen,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"If you haven't played it 3d world is like a big expansion for 3d land that takes everything good from the 3ds game and amplifies it. There is a ridiculous amount of content in 3d world, I'm pretty sure it has the most levels in a Mario game to date but what is more amazing is that no level feels the same, each one has a unique gimmick or theme and the game keeps this up until the end. There's also 4 player co op which can be played online or local, one fun thing about co op that the highest scoring player gets a crown and the other players can try and steal it by knocking it off, its just dumb fun. The music in general is fantastic. Nintendo always does a great job of remixing their classic tunes and 3d world is no exception, I particularly like the jazz rendition of the main theme and bowsers castle theme(go listen to them). 3d world is simply joy to play, sure it might not have the highly technical move sets of 64 or sunshine but that isn't necessarily a bad thing considering how easy it is to pick up and enjoy. It doesn't have the highpoints of Nintendo's greatest but its solid, all good from start to finish."
GIMI3,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"This is THE best Mario game I have played in a long time. I never got the opportunity to play it on the Wii U but always wanted to. Now, here it is 8 years later, with better resolution and a solid 60 fps. 3D World alone was worth the purchase, but the inclusion of Bowsers Fury made it even better. They could have just thrown the original game and I would have been happy! Bowsers Fury is massive and gorgeous, the music is amazing, and the feeling of being chased by Giga Bowser is exhilarating. They revamped movement speeds too! So the characters never feel sluggish. If you love Mario games and havent played this, go get it!! (PS, to the person who has only played the Wii U version and gave this a 6, you need to take yourself elsewhere unless you actually play THIS version. They are not the same and your review is invalid.)"
MarioKartfans,"Feb 14, 2021",8,"Super Mario 3D World on its own is an amazing game. With great level design and a wealth of new ideas and fun gimmicks in every level. With so many levels you would think they would repeat ideas but they don’t. Then after you beat the main game their are challenge worlds that are even more fun to beat. On top of all of this, they added one of the coolest things to come from a Mario Game since the Dragon Kingdom in Odyssey. In Bowsers Fury it’s a fun and new open world Mario experience with great challenge and fun. It’s a long experience too, it will take you 5 to 6 hours to fully complete it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good 3D platformer."
Kakadu,"Feb 15, 2021",9,"The base game 3D World is fantastic. Top notch mario in my opinion. And Bowser’s Fury BLEW ME AWAY! It exploded my expectations, it was something different, new, and kept me on my toes.. Hopefully it’s a hint at what’s to come next for 3D Mario.. because if they take Bowser’s fury which is Mario 3D world move set and power ups, placed in an open area.. and combine that with Odyssey’s worlds... I think that would be EPIC! I loved Odyssey but wished there was a 3D mario without the gimmicks.. Combine bowsers fury’s controls with odyssey worlds NINTENDO"
Mips,"Feb 15, 2021",9,"Bowser's Fury is a Mario Fans dream with a massive open Sandbox of a level to play in (Probably the size of five of the kingdoms from Odyssey rolled up into one.) And over 100 thought out Cat Shines to collect. It also puts the Platforming back in Sandbox Mario titles unlike Odyssey that was probably 90% Mindless Collectathon and 10% Platformer. Honestly one of the best Mario experiences I've had in years. As for 3D world, they increased the running speed, added improvements to the game over all, and added a four player online mode for the entire game which is a big deal for Nintendo. There are also some new Captain Toad stages. Giving the Game a 9 because there is also a Death Counter  that appears on the main menu of the game after you beat it as a way to say ""Hey you beat the game but you died this many times!"" To me that feels like a punishment over a reward, I don't want to be reminded of how many times I died in a game every time I boot up the start menu."
kimoomaster,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"While the Wii U was certainly some dark times for Nintendo, there’s no denying that the first party offerings were just as stellar as ever. You know that with how much of the system’s library has released on the Switch over the past 4 years with the latest being Mario's main 3D adventure on the system. I remember covering the game back in 2013 and was generally impressed with what was on offer but ultimately the game felt like a step back from the series previous offering with Galaxy, but at that point Wii U owners were so starved for new titles we were more than happy to play it. The game centred around Bowser being a general nuisance and kidnapping the sprixies from the Sprixie Kingdom and it is up to Mario and friends to save the day, the game was the follow up to 3D Land on the 3DS, with many of the same features including a large number of powerups from the Tanooki suit to the brand new Cat Suit Booting it up on Switch in 2021 does bring a sense of hindsight though, after playing through the HD ports of Sunshine, the original Galaxy and of course Odyssey these past few years, going back to 3D World feels almost archaic. Firstly, Mario's Moveset in this game is incredibly restrictive, as I was playing I was frequently wondering why Mario wasn't throwing his hat or even just twirling while he jumped, in fact Mario's jumps in this game feel incredibly floaty and inaccurate compared to other titles, it isn’t helped with the camera angles not giving me proper depth perception. In terms of performance, it’s identical to the original version in regards to framerate, presentation-wise, It's pretty much a straight port of the Wii U version with the only motion controls being used to replicate the Gamepad touch moments, holding the shoulder button brings up a pointer that you use to interact with the built-in gyros. This is one time I would rather undock the game and just use the touch controls on the Switch’s gamepad. While 3D World isn’t the most robust Mario title, it's far from being inferior introducing aspects like the Cat Suit, the adorable Captain Toad and of course 4 player multiplayer. The Switch version does expand on that with Online Co-op but we were unable to try that out at the time of this review But the reason why we are all here is for the brand new expansion in ""Bowser's Fury"". While 3D World's camera controls and levels were fairly restrictive, Bowser's Fury is a full open world level similar to Odyssey, essentially forming a bridge between the two titles with it having the features of the newer iteration like just losing coins at death. Which begs the question why they even decided to keep the lives in the main game, one turtle exploit and several minutes of your time and you’ll have more lives than you know what to do with. Falling down a black portal Mario finds himself in a brand new world with an angry giant Bowser and a worried Junior who needs your help calming his father down with the help of Cat Shines. While you can play as Bowser Jr in co-op, there is no way to play as him in single-player mode, he instead offers help in combat as well as holding onto multiple power-ups. As Mario is completing numerous missions to collect cat shines like races or reuniting a poor crying cat with her kittens, Bowser will sometimes poke his head up, turn the sky all gloomy and rain destruction on you for like a minute. Honestly, this is more a hindrance than anything else before you unlock the new giant kitty bell and are just looking to collect the shinies. While Bowser's Fury is an impressive addition to 3D World, it will barely clock in any more than 6 hours of playthrough which in this reviewers opinion, really doesn't justify double-dipping. I wouldn't say 3D World is an inferior Mario title but it is absolutely standing in the shadows of its bigger bros. But if you were one of the many who never purchased the Wii U version, 3D World with Bowser’s Fury does offer that classic Mario platforming fun, but I wouldn’t blame you if you pop in Odyssey right afterwards...."
yertre,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"3D World is a lot of fun if not slightly too easy. Although similar to a lot of recent releases the challenge comes from finding all the collectables and the post game of which is fairly meaty. Bowsers Fury seems great for an add-on to an existing game and would definitely hope to see a full length take on this formula some day. I would say if you're expecting a 64/Odyssey style game you may be disappointed as for me 3D World is more of  logical step from the 2D games rather than the other 3D titles. My one real criticism would be sometimes it's difficult to judge where you're going to land your jumps."
megahayden,"Feb 18, 2021",9,"By far the best Wii U port to make this switch. Currently playing the Switch version and its a blast! Buy it, Super Mario 3D World alone is worth £60 and Bowser’s Fury is just another reason as to why you should want to buy it even if you owned the game before on Wii U. Bowser’s Fury is just a fantastic experience and it is a great add on as to what is already a great game (its like DLC but the best kind). This game is a better example of what Wii U ports should be and Nintendo practically nailed it. Just one thing that needs improvement and may come in a major update or patch. The little bit of work on textures and material on both games as well as a 1080p60 enhancement for Bowser’s Fury when docked. Aside that , best game so far of 2032 (at least of the time when writing this its the best game of the year so far). And what a way to end Super Mario's 35th Anniversary as well."
Stratocasterhz,"Feb 15, 2021",9,"I hadn't gotten to play Super Mario 3D World when it was on the Wii U, so my first experience with it has been on the Switch. If you're playing it by yourself, I would give 3D world a 7/10. It's a very solid mainline Mario title and I don't have much more to say about it. I'd give it an extra half point for an 8/10 if you're playing it with a few friends. Me and my daughter had a blast playing it together. It's truly the multi-player options that set it apart. Now, the 10/10 I've awarded to the game is purely due to Bowser's Fury, which, if it were expanded into a full fledged independent mainline Mario game, it would probably hands down become my favorite mainline Mario game in the entire series. This is exactly what I wanted Super Mario Odyssey to be. Its open level design is exquisite, it strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and challenge for younger players, and I desperately hope all of the ideas here are a mere pre-cursor to whatever Nintendo plans to do with Mario next. I can't begin to even describe what I wouldn't give to have an open level world exactly like Bowser's Fury to explore on the scale of Breath of the Wild. Bowser's Fury is literally everything I want out of mainline Mario titles going forward."
Gangoon,"Feb 17, 2021",8,"Like Videogamedunkey said, it is so much easier to appreciate 3D World now that Odyssey is out. What made this game disappointing back in 2013 is what makes it stand out from the rest of the series today. 3D World is simply put the purest 3D Mario game ever created (along with 3D Land). Mario is originally about going from point A to B, and that is exactly what 3D World provides, but in a 3D environment. I used to be very annoyed at the way that 3D World almost completely neglects the story/atmosphere/immersion factors from games like the Galaxies and Sunshine. But like I said previously, that simplicity and the focus on action is what makes 3D World distinct from every other 3D Mario. This is a game that goes straight to the beef: no cutscenes, no hub world, no level recycling, only jumping from new stage to new stage until the end. I love Mario games with atmosphere (like Galaxy) and exploration (like Odyssey), but sometimes you're just in the mood for something simple and straightforward like 3D World. Having single, linear levels instead of ones that you re-visit allows for a very focused and refined level design. Stages in 3D World are elegant and simple, and they all follow the same formula: Introduce an idea, expand it, and finally twist it around. There's a good video by Game Maker's Toolkit that explains it properly. The difficulty is mostly low, but the game is very fun regardless. The final level probably is one of the hardest things to come out of a Nintendo game in my opinion. Getting used to the controls can be a little tricky, and even after 50 hours between both versions, I'm still often miscalculating jumps and falling of cliffs because of depth-perception issues due to the fixed camera angles. One fantastic, game-changer tweak to this Switch port is the notable increase in the characters' movement speed, which almost makes this feel like a completely new experience (and a much more fun one). That was definitely a genius move by Nintendo. Even though 3D World leans heavily on more generic themes and abstract, 'landmass floating in the middle of nothing' levels, that doesn't mean that effort and care wasn't put into the art direction of this game. It's certainly much better than the uninspired 3D Land in that regard. And the soundtrack takes a delightful jazzy turn, with plenty of bangers to enjoy. And finally, there's Bowser's Fury. I could write an entire review for this mode, but I'll keep it short here. This mode is almost worth admission price by itself. It is so creative and exciting that it feels like a completely new Mario game, and not just an addition to 3D World. Bowser's Fury is probably the best marriage of open-ended exploration and tight, focused platforming that Mario has ever offered, and is certainly an amazing tease for what's to come for the series. Needless to say, it is a blast from start to finish, it is full of surprises, and it is honestly one of my favorite experiences I had with my Switch so far. Score: 9.2--"
IloveSuperMario,"Feb 18, 2021",9,"A very rare 10/10 but this game absolutely deserves it. I 100%ed the WiiU version back in 2015, but I chose to revisit this because my wife wanted a multiplayer game to play.  The game is just as terrific as I remember, and the addition of Bowser's Fury is a nice extra treat. At its core, this is a 2D Mario platformer elongated and translated into the 3D space.  It's got crazy power ups, tons of secrets, bonus worlds, fun as hell music, creativity dripping from every orifice (that's a horrible mental image why did I say that), really memorable levels, throwbacks to older Mario titles...it's really all here. ...that being said Champion's Road is still a pain in my ass, lol"
Jpr199,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"The low skill floor and high skill ceiling makes this the perfect party or family game. I've 100% completed the game in the past on wiiU and look forward to doing it again on switch. The amount of content you get is amazing, and (unlike a certain other Mario game) every star feels meaningful and special to get. There's some trickiness to the platforming caused by the 3D setting, but it's still incredibly well done and excellent to control."
jte,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"It's Mario, so I guess you can already tell it will be amazing. One of the best 3D Mario games with very colorful and visually amazing stages, great controls and very good platforming variety from easy to challenging stages. On the top of it though, here comes Browser's Fury which is the most fun I had with an open world 3D platforming except Mario Oddysey even though it's not far at all from its level, but it feels like a testing project which is going to be a game some day (without having any problems or bugs of course). I really loved the idea and I hope they make something more complete in the feature like a game itself because this one felt like a DLC. I believe it's a must play even if you have, or not, played it before."
Jdd2102,"Feb 13, 2021",9,"3D世界还是传统的马力欧箱庭式过关并且收集星星与图章，不过从2D到了3D。亮点是可以最多四人一起玩（全程一个人）以及变身猫咪和狸猫，关卡难度有难有简单，通关前的关卡还是比较简单的，3星不难。通关后的银河关卡明显难了一个档次，甚至都很难走到终点。狂怒世界个人感觉更好玩，开放世界到处都是关卡和游戏，能看到游戏是在为奥德赛做准备。还能和库巴王Jr.一起冒险，通关后就可以传送了，而且可以看到哪些地方还有没有收集到的星星，比较人性。总体来说这个游戏还是传统的马力欧游戏，20+小时，收集数量和质量也很合理。但价格较高，建议打折时入手。"
Fourrow,"Feb 15, 2021",9,"this game is amazing , overall it's better than the wii u version and the bowser's furry is really fun open world game even though it's pretty short for a new content for the game itself, this game deserve higher score / better score than it should be (the wii u version is 93 on metacritic). so overall super mario 3d world + bowser's furry is an amazing game and this is one of the best mario game on nintendo switch."
BrettSMM,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"One of the best Wii U ports ever. This game is amazing and it's so good seeing this game with some bonus content added. You can even play with friends online or locally! Even though I partially completed this game on the Wii U, it was a great time. Now for Bowser's Fury, it's pretty amazing to see a game like odyssey being added as bonus content for the port. I mainly played solo for both games but I still had a great time. After beating Super Mario 3D World and 100% Bowser's Fury, I can say that this is worth the 60$ price tag."
craftsle,"Feb 13, 2021",9,"I love Mario 3D games but this is definitely the weakest of the bunch. In short it's a 2D Mario game (which I'm much less keen on) in a 3D format. As a result it's a lot less fun than Galaxy or Odyssey. However... Bowser's Fury is fantastic! What a great bonus game. Yes it's short (about 7-8 hours to finish everything) but it's a fresh twist on the 3D games. Plays like one giant end of game boss level. The full price tag is almost worth if for Fury alone."
MisterMacys,"Apr 13, 2021",9,"Super Mario 3D World is my favorite Mario game to date. It's basically a classic Mario game but in 3D. Each level is linear (although also filled with secret spots) and this lets the game strike you with an incredible idea after another one in a continuous manner, (thanks also to the fast pace of the game and the shortness of the stages) making each course feel new.The new Odyssey moveset added in the port makes the whole game more fluid and adds a ton of possibilities, if you try to speedrun a level it helps you a lot. This is especially noticeable in the hardest stages. (I wish there were more of those because they feel very different from the rest of the game).Then you have the multiplayer, if you have at least a friend to play this game, then this game will turn into the physical manifestation of fun. Each player tries to compete for the most points and sabotages the others, but they also have to arrive to the goal in time of course, so the game turns into a very entertaining mix of cooperation and competitiveness. There's also a lot of ""Mario Party **** especially because each of the characters has different properties to their movement, this may be subjective but I personally think it enhances the social experience a lot.The music is, as always, incredible and the art style is of course traditional, but it has a shine to it, I can't quite describe it but it looks very pretty, like luminous.The only problem I had with the game is that sometimes the depth perception is off and the camera is uncomfortable, but it's not a major deal.As for Browser's Fury, it's a fun, open world 1-player experience. But it's short, it was mostly made to sell the bundle, it's obviously a bonus experience more than its own game, so I wouldn't advice buying the pack just because of it."
ChaseU,"Feb 14, 2021",9,"Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is one of (if not the) best ports Nintendo have ever done. They gave the already great game a ton of QoL improvements, including a brand new move (the mid-air dive), increased running speed, online play, multiplayer in the captain toad levels and a bunch of other small tweaks like fully colorized stamps, a new snapshot mode and the game loading in the background.The increased speed and new dive move make the game feel legitimately fresh, and the game is more suited for switch than Wii U in my opinion with its pick up and play nature and not being the only 3D Mario game. But that's only half the story with this game. Bowser's Fury is the brand new side-quest. It's basically an open world Mario game using Mario 3D world's engine. Despite its short length, taking only around 3 hours to beat and 6 to 100%, Bowser's Fury is a lot of fun and makes sure that both fans of Mario's more linear outings like 3D Land and the 2D games and fans of the open world games like 64 and Odyssey can get a lot of enjoyment out of this package. Overall it's two great adventures with amazing sound tracks, great designs and lots of fun to be had. However, here are some points of criticism: - While the speed increase is overall a great change, the rest of the game isn't at all tweaked to suit the higher speeds. This can make some sections like some bosses, rolling hills, or stairs you need to jump on feel a bit jarring.- There isn't much in terms of replay value in either 3D World or Bowser's Fury, unless you're into speedrunning. The games emphasis on multiplayer (which to be fair, is a ton of fun) leaves me desiring some kind of multiplayer mode like a coin battle or fighting mode.- 3D World doesn't really have it's own identity visually or gameplay wise. It's mainly a great Mario platformer, but not much more than that.- Bowser's Fury reuses a lot of ideas and you have to do the same thing (fight shadow Luigi, have Fury Bowser break blocks etc.) a bunch of times each. This makes it a bit tedious to 100% complete.- Bowser's Fury also doesn't run to well, mainly when bowser is in his fury state. Most of these are nitpicks, and i do still think the game is amazing and i whole-heartedly recommend it to any fans of Mario games or 3D platformers in general"
Syhlcam,"Feb 15, 2021",8,Ame el juego de principio a fin el online funciona super bien y el Bowser fury lo mejor lo recomiendo y mucho.
3vg69,"Feb 13, 2021",8,"As a lifelong Nintendo and Super Mario fan, this is pretty disappointing, and sadly, I'm used to it.It's a Wii U game with a DLC sold for 60 dollars, which is already infuriating but it's what Nintendo does, and we keep buying. I just have to take that under consideration when I rate the game.The game is fun, for a while, but the design of the levels feels pretty lazy, the camera is terrible most of the time and they use too many cheap tricks to make you play the level again and again. Mario Odyssey was awesome, this is not.I thought the game was super cool the first 2 o 3 hours I played, but if you start paying attention, you will see that this game has nothing special.I just hope Nintendo puts more effort for the next one."
NinteXbox,"Feb 18, 2021",9,"The camera is extremely uncomfortable，and Bowser's funy is so chaotic. Like ING said：“Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury packs a tonne of engaging gameplay, but neither component comes together as elegantly as it might have done. This is a solid option if you’re craving more Super Mario for your Switch, but it’s not the moustachioed must-play I was hoping for.”"
Stingy11089,"Feb 23, 2021",9,"Mario 3D World was one of my favorite Wii U games, and I'm happy to finally have it on my switch.Now I won't have to dust off the Wii U anymore. That's great.Now, about the game: It's honestly just 2D Mario games in 3D with some Multiplayer components and great music. That being said, you won't feel challenged by the game until you hit the bonus worlds. Included in the bundle is Bowsers Fury. And it's just 3D World combined with the open design and controls of Mario Odyssey. It's fun, but not worth the price if you just wanna play this new expansion. Also, don't complete it 100% if you don't want too since you only get a picture for it. Verdict: A great bundle. But nothing we haven't seen before. Rating:Gameplay: 4/5 - Pure bliss. But lacking challenge.Level Design: 4/5 - Great and sometimes even experimental.Soundtrack: 3/5 - Absolutely great. But repetitive after a while.Story: 2/5 - We've seen way better Mario plots before.Graphics: 5/5 - Great. Nothing to add here.Length: 5/5 - Sooooooo much content!Replay Value: 1/5 - Pretty much none, other than going back through the game and completing every level perfectly with every character.Enjoyment: 4/5 - This was a great time worth coming back to. Overall rating: 28/40 => 7/10"
nahobino5_,"Jun 27, 2021",9,"Super Mario 3D World è un bel gioco, ma non è al livello degli altri Mario 3d del calibro di Mario64, galaxy o Odissey, sembra una versione più ispirata di New Super Mario Bros. Detto questo, rimane un buon gioco ma non è assolutamente il miglior platform 3d di sempre, ha molti livelli con buone idee, ma la bassa difficoltà e longevità degli stessi livelli li rende immediatamente dimenticabili. Bowser Fury invece è la vera sorpresa della cartuccia di gioco, per quanto sia una piccola espansione da 4 ore per il 3D World, l'ho trovato molto più divertente e creativo. Per tirare le somme, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser Fury è un buon pacchetto completo che mi ha divertito e sorpreso per diverse ore di gioco."
davygravy93,"Feb 14, 2021",8,"This newest instalment is not a very original game. All this truly is, is a port from the Wii U with a new ¨DLC¨ With few changes to the game, it´s kind of sad to see such a beautiful game be redone with this poor port. Honestly the Bowser´s fury is just a ¨DLC¨ for those who think that it changes much. Same gamplay with minimal control changes and just a new powerup that it like the Mega Mushroom."
CDizzness,"Feb 14, 2021",9,I hate this dumb game. These stupid developers made the game almost impossible to enjoy playing. Increasing the speed of the characters to infinity miles per hour doesn't necessarily mean you made the game easier to play and/or enjoy. I honestly don't know how they messed up this badly making a remake.
AVD_Ratings,"Feb 15, 2021",,"You will be done with 3D World in 2 days. The levels are mind numbingly easy, and you will see levels being recycled just a couple of hours in. All replay value or challenge comes from having to go back and replay levels over and over again, because you don't know where a star is or just to grab the flagpole from the top, since you need to do that to unlock the last world. Sometimes you get a green star by completing a challenge in a purple box.  If you fail, you have to kill yourself to try again. Bowser's Fury is also really boring, it's an ""open world"" with terrible camera controls. The camera doesn't follow Mario, and you can only move it in tiny increments. While needing to hold the run button. It is not worth $60, unless you plan to play with friends, but anything is fun when with friends."
rafaeldamoneto,"Feb 13, 2021",,"The best thing you can say about Super Mario 3D World is that it's inoffensive. So inoffensive that it becomes offensive. It's insubstantial, forgettable, and definitely not worth $60. Even with all the flak 3D All-Stars got for not being updated and upgraded enough (as they should- they're supposed to be CLASSICS remember), that collection is the best of the 3D Mario cartridges to get on the Switch. Buy it before supplies run out and it gets kicked off of the Switch eShop, leaving you with the mediocre Odyssey and 3D World. But wait! There's also a new game, Bowser's Fury! And it's the worst 3D Mario game in existence. This game would not be played by many people had it not been tacked onto a re-release of 3D World, another game not many people played the first time. First off, it features controls and mechanics similar to 3D World, but it's set in a big open world with all the levels connected. This makes the game absolutely CHUG and if only that were the worst problem. This game continues the modern Nintendo tradition of being toothlessly easy. You have five separate power-up slots, one for each power-up, and you can store multiple power-ups. You will constantly have more power-ups than you will ever need for each situation. Even if you forget you have them and die, there's hardly any consequences. And as the only new content for this duology, it's short and lacks replay value, not giving Wii U players much of a reason to buy this re-release. It's worth noting that while playing this game, both of my pairs of Joy-Cons have the Drift now. I prefer playing my Switch in handheld mode and I don't like using the Pro Controller. I grew up playing the N64, during a Nintendo Dark Age, and I've stuck with Nintendo ever since, even buying their older systems and games from before. I don't know if I can continue buying Nintendo's new consoles after the Switch. Sales nonwithstanding, the Switch is the most disappointing Nintendo generation for me and I feel like an alien from a foreign planet seeing the regular hype and glowing praise for its games."
Kacak123,"Feb 13, 2021",,"A luxurious and high-caliber platform game that has no competition except for other Mario games. The game is already luxurious since the Wii U.

HENOOB,"Feb 14, 2021",,"I, like many others, didn't like 3d World when it first came out, but in retrospect, this game is great! It's rather linear and restrictive when compared to the more open ended nature of the previous games, but that's not really a bad thing, because the game is filled to the brim with creative ideas and it's linearity allows it to channel it in a focused manner.

YanisPLAYER,"Feb 14, 2021",,"A great port of Super Mario 3D World! The characters and visuals move more quicker, a lot of new features and new mechanics that haven't been seen in the Original Wii U release. Also, the fact that this is the 5th 3D Mario game (3 if you count 3D All Stars as one game) to be on the Switch is also incredible. Bowser's Fury is a great mode too! It even feels like that it could be it's own"
FranciscoPlayer,"Feb 14, 2021",,"If you haven't played it 3d world is like a big expansion for 3d land that takes everything good from the 3ds game and amplifies it. There is a ridiculous amount of content in 3d world, I'm pretty sure it has the most levels in a Mario game to date but what is more amazing is that no level feels the same, each one has a unique gimmick or theme and the game keeps this up until the end."
NintendoFan9501,"Feb 13, 2021",,"This is THE best Mario game I have played in a long time. I never got the opportunity to play it on the Wii U but always wanted to.

HazeTheHawk13,"Feb 15, 2021",,Bowser's Fury is a Mario Fans dream with a massive open Sandbox of a level to play in (Probably the size of five of the kingdoms from Odyssey rolled up into one.) And over 100 thought out Cat Shines to collect. It also puts the Platforming back in Sandbox Mario titles unlike Odyssey that was probably 90% Mindless Collectathon and 10% Platformer. Honestly one of the best Mario experiences

sergioodoardi,"Feb 13, 2022",,"3D World is a lot of fun if not slightly too easy. Although similar to a lot of recent releases the challenge comes from finding all the collectables and the post game of which is fairly meaty. Bowsers Fury seems great for an add-on to an existing game and would definitely hope to see a full length take on this formula some day. I would say if you're expecting a 64/Odyssey style game"

If you're playing it by yourself, I would give 3D world a 7/10. It's a very solid mainline Mario title and I don't have much more to say about it. I'd give it an extra half point for an 8/10 if you're playing it with a few friends. Me and my daughter had a blast"
EnigmaXtreme,"Feb 16, 2021",,"Like Videogamedunkey said, it is so much easier to appreciate 3D World now that Odyssey is out. What made this game disappointing back in 2013 is what makes it stand out from the rest of the series today. 3D World is simply put the purest 3D Mario game ever created (along with 3D Land). Mario is originally about going from point A to B, and that is exactly what 3D World provides, but in a"
